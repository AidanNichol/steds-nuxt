    <li> The bus normally leaves Tynemouth at 8.00 am (7.00 am during the summer). It goes along the Broadway to Whitley
      Bay, up Front Street Monkseaton and along the old coast road to South Gosforth picking up at various points
      along the way. See the <nuxt-link to="/downloads/StEdsBusRoute.pdf">Bus Route</nuxt-link> for detailed information.
    </li>
    <li> You may put your rucksack and bag with a change of clothes in the boot of the bus.</li>
    <li> After the last pick-up point, a check is made that the people on the bus match those that booked.</li>
    <li> There is usually a varied mix of communications to members that get circulated around the bus, e.g. minutes of
      meetings, booking lists, press cuttings etc.
    </li>
    <li> The bookings secretary usually goes around the bus collecting in outstanding payment. Bookings for future walks can be made at this time.</li>
    <li> An announcement will be made about the arrangements for the evening stop after the walk</li>
    <li> The most important item that always gets circulated is the map showing the days walk. There will be at least
      three walks on a walk&#8209;day, to accommodate the various levels of fitness and ability among members on the
      day. Each person needs to select which walk they will go on. See the separate
      section for advice on <nuxt-link to="/Walk_Organization/choice_of_walk">choosing a walk</nuxt-link>.
    </li>
    <li> Somebody will come around and note your decision. It is important that you don't just go off on a different
      walk.
    </li>
    <li> The bus usually makes a short stop around 9.00 for coffee.</li>
    <li> We usually start walking around 10:00. An announcement will advise that the start point for each walk has been
      reached.
    </li>
    <li> Having enjoyed a good days walking you will arrive back at the bus and can change out of your walking gear into
      casual clothes for the evening.
    </li>
    <li> Adjourn to the local hostelry or tea room and socialise with your fellow walkers. Sometimes we just stay there
      for a while giving everybody chance to have a meal and sometimes we have a shorter stay and stop somewhere else
      on the way home for a meal.
    </li>
    <li> The bus retraces it's route back home dropping off people on the way. Return times can vary considerable
      depending on where we go. To be safe you should plan on the bus arriving back in Tynemouth at approx. 9.00 pm.
