        The whole process starts in Autumn when the walks
        co-ordinator encourages members to submit their favourite
        walks for consideration as part of the following years
        programme. By members acceptance of this encouragement, the
        Club is now able to offer a wider range of walks and walking
        areas. This usually happens by circulating a list around the
        bus on the walks.
      </li>
      <li>
        The walks co-ordinator then suggests to the committee a
        balanced programme for the following year in terms of the
        places where we will walk. The final programme is the
        responsibility of the whole committee.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then the co-ordinator comes back to the members seeking
        volunteers to take responsibility for organizing a specific
        day's walking. Once all the walks have organizers the programme
        is distributed to all the members. (Again by circulating
        lists on the bus). If you are thinking of volunteering to
        organize a walk the take a look at the

      </li>
      <li>
        The organizer for a walk is responsible for planning all the
        individual walks that will happen on the day: usually there
        are four walks.
        <ol class="simpleList">
          <li>
            A 15-16 mile walk which will tend to reach the higher hills
            and is intended for the stronger walker.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 12-13 mile walk that will still tend to go fairly high but
            over a shorter distance.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 9-10 mile walk, which is similar to the 2nd walk with
            perhaps, less height gained.
          </li>
          <li>
            A 6-9 mile walk that is essentially low level with minimal
            hill walking.
          </li>
        </ol class="simpleList">
      </li>
      <li>
        The organizer has to present the detail of the walks,
        (description, maps etc), to the committee six weeks prior to
        the day and amendments may be made.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leaders are appointed for the individual walks and they are
        usually supplied the map of the walk they are to lead two
        week before the walk giving them time to familiarise
        themselves with it before the day.
      </li>
    </ul>
