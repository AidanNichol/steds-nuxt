  <p>Leaders will be picked from competent club members. Club policy is to encourage Members to want to lead walks, with positive support from other senior club members if wanted or required.</p>

  <p>The leader of a walk has the responsibility of ensure that the group has an enjoyable and safe day out. If you are leading a walk then there are things you need to do.</p>

  <ul class="simpleList">
    <li>Usually, you will have been selected as leader well in advance of a walk. Use that time to prepare yourself on matters concerning their walk e.g. the nature of the terrain, items of interest along the route, speed of group and to pre-plan escape routes
      for use in an emergency.</li>

    <li>Ensure that the party has the necessary group equipment with them, e.g. GPS, KSU's, Cas-straps, first-aid etc. You don't have to carry all of these personally but they need to be available to you should things go wrong.</li>

    <li>If you have a mobile phone, ensure that is charged up and switched on. You never know when one of the other groups may need to call you for assistance or to warn you of problems on your route ahead.
    </li>

    <li>Pick a "sweeper" to bring up the rear of the party before walk starts. This is particularly important if the party is large.</li>

    <li>Leaders, in particular, will encourage Members to look at and to use their maps and compasses. This not only helps breed new leaders but also improves the ability of the whole group to deal with unforeseen circumstances.</li>

    <li>As the leader, you need to be in contact with all members of your group at all times i.e. look to the tail and to the front for tearaways to keep your group as a group.</li>

    <li>If you find many "fast lasses" (or "lads"), You MAY decide it is in the best interests of the rest of the group to have a breakaway group. You must ensure that the breakaway group conforms to the minimum group size, has map, compass and essential
      safety kit with them, that they are made aware that their safety is to become their own responsibility and that the return time to the bus will be the same as that for the rest of the walkers.</li>

    <li>If you have any walkers in the group who are having difficulty while the walk is in progress, you MAY decide to split the group as above, to slow down or even stop the main group. It is the YOUR decision, in consultation with the group. Safety for
      ALL members of a group is paramount consideration. Contact with other groups to pass on such information, e.g. by phone checks, where possible, becomes vital. You may be able to transfer walkers to other groups or you may need to exercise an escape
      route.</li>

    <li>As the leader, keep walks to the published distances, time of arrival back at the bus and the route agreed before the walk commences. This is a safety requirement. If anything happens on your walk then you will be more easily found if you are where
      you are supposed to be. Also one of the other walks may need to contact you if they have problem which will be problematic if you aren't where you should be.</li>

    <li>Ensure that the group returns to the coach, where possible, no later than the appointed finishing time. Walks should be timed to arrive back at the bus AT the appointed time. It is frustrating for others if your group is very late OR VERY EARLY in
      its return.</li>
