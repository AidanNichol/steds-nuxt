    <p>An emergency is any event which prevents normal completion of a
      walk. </p>

      <h5>On the Fells:</h5>

      <ul class="simpleList">
        <li>
          If you become split from the main body of their group and
          are unable see which way their group has gone;
          <strong>STAY PUT</strong><br />
          Use emergency whistle, signals etc, to attract attention as
          quickly as possible better to do it sooner than later. (six
          blasts with a minute's silence, repeated even when the
          acknowledgement is heard - three blasts during the minute's
          silence).
        </li>
        <li>
          If assistance is needed, attempt to contact other St Edward's
          walking parties, to advise them
          of the situation BEFORE contacting emergency services (an extreme situation may over-ride
          the initial Club contact)
        </li>

        <li>
          The whole group will pool resources to help the casualty.
        </li>

        <li>
          At least two (2) members the group WILL REMAIN with the casualty to
          give maximum comfort and help.
        </li>

        <li>
          At least two (2) members of the group will GO FOR ASSISTANCE.
        </li>

        <li>
          Leader of the party will decide, if the situation allows, whether
          any balance of members the party continue their walk; always providing such a sub-group
          contains competent leadership.
        </li>

        <li>
          At ALL times the leader's decision must prevail. This will dictate
          the action of the party.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Getting Assistance</h5>
      <p>The following MINIMUM WRITTEN information is required:</p>
      <ul class="simpleList">
        <li>Accurate grid reference and time of the occurrence.  </li>
        <li>Brief factual description of the accident and any problems</li>
        <li>Personal details of the casualty.
          <ul>
            <li>Name</li>
            <li>Age.(accurate or estimated)</li>
            <li>Home address and telephone number</li>
            <li>Prior medical history, if any, if known</li>
            <li>Blood Group</li>
            <li>Emergency contact and phone number</li>
          </ul>
          <li>What action is proposed by the party
            remaining with the casualty </li>
            <li>What action proposed by any other part of that walk
              group.</li>
            </ul>
            Getting assistance may involve returning to high ground in order to receive mobile phone signal. Taking multiple phones on different networks would increase the probability of success.
