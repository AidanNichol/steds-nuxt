          accurately fixed.</li>

          <li>The club has four KSU's (Karrimor Survival Units) and each walk will carry one for
            emergency use, as well as to familiarise members in their use.</li>

            <li>There are 4 (?) sets of Club Cas-straps available and at least 12 other sets that are the
              personal property of members.</li>

            <h5>Composition of a Group:</h5>

            <ul class="simpleList">
              <li>For group control and safety on the fells, a <strong>maximum</strong> of 15 walkers in a
                group is recommended - subject to the discretion of the group leader. The party may be split to
                achieve this recommendation, the main leader appointing a secondary leader and "sweeper".</li>

                <li>Again for safety on the fells a group <strong>minimum</strong> of 5 is recommended. Such
                  small groups MUST include at least two persons who are competent with map and compass and the
