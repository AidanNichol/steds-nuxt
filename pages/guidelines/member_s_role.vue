  <p>As a member your actions can contribute to the safety and enjoyment of the
    whole group</p>
    <ul class="simpleList">
      <li>
        You will be fully and properly equipped for Club walks.
        See <nuxt-link to="guidelines/personal_equipment/"> Personal Equipment</nuxt-link>. Especially make sure you have
        sufficient liquid and are prepared for changes in the weather.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose a walk which you consider you can
        finish <strong>on the day, in the time allowed</strong>,
        taking into
        consideration the weather, the expected conditions underfoot
        and your personal health and fitness. Don't learn the
        hard way about the need to make a suitable choice of walk
        <em>before</em> starting out. See
        <nuxt-link to="/Walk_Organization/choice_of_walk/"> choice of walk</nuxt-link> for more on this subject.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a walk leader considers a walk well beyond your
        ability on the day, then accept the leader's
        decision, and choose a less strenuous walk that day.
      </li>
      <li>
        The walk leader is concerned with the safety and enjoyment
        of the whole group. Give him or her your full support and help
        in any way you can. Accept a leader's decision, after consultation
        where necessary, as final.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do your utmost to stay with the main body of
        the walking group. If you find you are having difficulty
        in keeping up for any reason then let the leader know. Don't
        get too far ahead of the main body, slow down and wait.
      </li>
      <li>If another walker is having trouble think what you can do to
        help. Often, moral support is all that is needed.</li>
        <li>
          Conduct yourselves, at all times, in a manner
          which will enhance the good name of the Club.
        </li>
        <li>
          14 - 16 year olds must be accompanied by a responsible
          adult. If that is you, then you need to be able to look after
          them and be  responsible for them at ALL times.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If, through your actions or lack of preparation, you put other walkers in danger, then YOU
        will be held personally responsible for the outcomes due to such actions or lack of personal
        preparation.</p>

        <p>The Club Guidelines are for the safety and well being of members and repeated serious breaches
          of them by a member could result in disciplinary action being taken by the Committee. At worst this may lead regrettably to a member being expelled from the club.</p>
