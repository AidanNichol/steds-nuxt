    <p>The need for Club Guidelines arose from incidents on past walks. Members are urged to be
      familiar with these Guidelines and to strive to attain the recommendations contained within
      them.</p>
      <p>While the club takes every effort to ensure the safety of our members, it
        still remains that everybody participate entirely at their own risk.  The bottom line is that every individual is responsible for their own safety. St Edward's Fellwalkers Club cannot be held responsible for any accident, or for any
        individual's shortcomings. </p>

        <p>These guidelines cover the spectrum from individuals being
          <nuxt-link to="/guidelines/equipment/">properly equipped</nuxt-link>,
          through the role of <nuxt-link to="/guidelines/membersRole/"> members</nuxt-link> and
          <nuxt-link to="/guidelines/leadersRole/">leaders</nuxt-link>
          on the day, through to how how we
          <nuxt-link to="/guidelines/emergencyPlanning/">prepare</nuxt-link>

          <p><em>If you are a member of another club and wish to use these
            guidelines in part or in whole then do so at your own risk.
            Conversely, if you see ways to improve them then please
            <nuxt-link to="/guidelines/contact_us/">contact us</nuxt-link>
            - we are always willing to learn and improve our procedures</em></p>
